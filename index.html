          <h3>WHAT IS HENNA</h3>
          <p>
            Henna is a small flowering shrub that has many uses.
            The fragrant flowers are used to create perfume,
            and the leaves are dried and then turned into a fine powder
            that’s used for dying clothes, hair and temporarily dying the skin — hence henna tattooing.
            The plant has even been known to treat skin conditions.

          <h3>ORIGINATION OF HENNA</h3>
          <p>
            The exact origins of henna tattooing aren’t clear,
            however the tradition dates back as far as Ancient Egypt and South-East Asia.

          <h3>HENNA APPLICATION</h3>
          <p>
            The art of applying henna is traditionally used for celebrations and religious festivals.
            Every culture and region of the world uses henna tattoos in its own unique way.
            Depending on where you get henna tattoos, they will look different.
            Indian tattoos feature fine lines and floral patterns,
            while Arabic henna designs tend to be larger in scale and
            African henna patterns are more bold and geometric.
